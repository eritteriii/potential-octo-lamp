    <h1>Huskies</h1>
    <p>Huskies are floofy dogs of Siberian descent. They get their sense of sarcasm from their Russian roots. Don't let the communism fool you, these dogs are very selfish. They are pack animals that enjoy snoot boops and belly scritches. They don't mind being called fat, its in their name afterall.
